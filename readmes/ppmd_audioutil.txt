About:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tool can export various data from the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon : Explorers of Sky/Time/Darkness 
games(Only tested with Sky for now).

Right now it supports:
- Game text (Dialog, menus, item names, move names, pokemon names, etc..)
- Move data (Base power, type, name, descritpion, etc.. )
- Pokemon data (Name, category, type, stats growth, level-up moves, hm/tm moves, egg moves, etc..)

------------------------------
--Random Uninteresting Fact--:
------------------------------
The weird name is inspired from my EoS playthrough, where I cheated to get a Poochyena as starter. 
He turned out really good after ingesting so many gummies and pretty much carried the team 
most of the game! XD
And, I just love that pokemon, so yeah, that's pretty much it..

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* To export the entire pmd2 BGM folder, just specify the path to the rom's root directory 
  and the -pmd2 commandline option, like so :

    ppmd_audioutil.exe -pmd2 "pmd2_extractedrom/data" "out_bgm"

* To export a single SMDL file as-is, just drag and drop onto the executable.

* To export a single SMDL using conversion rules, to make it use standard MIDI instruments
  specify the path to the conversion info file, using the -cvinfo option at the commandline
  like this :

    ppmd_audioutil.exe "pmd2_extractedrom\SOUND\BGM\bgm0003.smd" "bgm0003.mid" -cvinfo "pmd2eos_cvinfo.xml" -fl 1
  
  The option -fl 1 tells the program to loop the track again once after it played. It will only loop 
  tracks that have a loop point though.
  
  You can make your own, edit, or add to the cvinfo XML file ! The details are in the example
  file "pmd2eos_cvinfo.xml" ! 
  
* To export the content of a SWDL file containing samples, simply drag and drop the file 
  onto the executable!
